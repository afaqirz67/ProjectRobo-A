# ProjectRobo-A
## Introductory 
As the name for this project suggest, this robot has 6 legs, each function with 3 servos for movement. This requires us 18 servos. The types of servos used for this robot is 
MG996R Servo Motor. The MG996R is essentially an upgraded version of the famous MG995 servo, and features upgraded shock-proofing and a redesigned PCB and IC control system that 
make it much more accurate than its predecessor. With that being said, this servo also has tail, and a head. This makes it look much like a real ant. The head is capable of seeing 
with help of an ultrasonic sensor placed in the head. It's also capable of moving up and down, while moving left and right too. Moreover, with those movements, the head will be 
able to rotate itself as well. That adds up 3 more servos. And one final servo is needed for the tail.  That brings up all the servos to a total of 23 servos. Though, the one 
of these servos for the head rotation unlike the other servos, is a SG90 Micro Servo Motor. The brain for this robot is a Mega Arduino. The Mega Arduino would be the only one that 
would be able to support this many servos. For powering this robot, a 3S LiPo Battery. This battery has a voltage of around 12v. It's capable of powering all the servos even if 
they were to run all at the same time. However, the servos operating voltage is limited from 4.8 to 7.2V, which means that we need to use a DC-DC buck converter to convert the 12V 
to 5V. The buck converter that is used for this project can handle up to 8 amps of current. For the control of this robot. I will be using an app to connect with a Wifi Shield. 
This gives the robot to be control via an IOS device, but just to back up this idea, having a Bluetooth Module isn't a bad idea. Although, the Bluetooth Module would be connected 
with an Android device. If not one, the other will work for sure. But our main goal here is to make it work with an IOS device. Last but not least, the body parts are going to be 
3D printed.

## Deadlines

Deadlines for this project will be in two phases each serving different parts of the project, but contain many shorter and more specific deadlines within. One would be building the robot and the parts, and the other would be coding and testing. All the deadlines are referred to in the timeline bellow.

Designing the parts, 3d printing, and assembling them.
